# Using the FBX file

If you're using the .fbx file, I'm going to assume (rightly or wrongly) that you already know what you're doing with multiple textures so crack on as you see fit with that. If you want the materials from the Blender file, I'm sure you already know what you're doing to get those.

If not, follow the same steps in the "[Using the Materials](./Materials/README.md)" section.
